PARAMOUR MULTI-ANIMATION CONTROLLER (PMAC) v1.0 (OSSL)
by Aine Caoimhe January 2015

USER INSTRUCTIONS


**** OVERVIEW *****

PMAC is designed with the intent that it be highly intuitive and easy to use
with absolutely no instruction at all. 
Hopefully this will be the case for most situations, although there is one menu
that only the owner can access -- 
the Edit menu -- that does require detailed instructions for safe use.

**** GENERAL USE -- ANIMATIONS AND GROUPS ****

To use a PMAC object it's as simple as "sit"....that's it!

Just sit on the object and PMAC will position you and play the current
animation. If it's in auto mode it will change 
animations every so often, cycling through the ones that are available based on
the currently loaded "animation group". 
If it isn't in auto mode, or if you want to select animations manually, you'll
need to touch the object after you sit 
on it to get the main controller menu. The first person who touches it will
automatically become the "controller".

Only one person can be in control of the menus and they must be seated on the
object. If someone else is seated and 
touches the object, they'll be asked if they want to "take control" away from
whoever has it (unless the owner has 
set it not to allow this). If you take control away from someone else you'll be
in charge and the other person will 
then be along for the ride. Since nobody likes a control war, it's usually a
good idea to speak to the current 
controller before simply grabbing it away from them.


If you've any other multi-avatar system of this type (like MLP) things will look
very familiar to you even though 
it works in a rather dramatically different way at the script level. An
"animation" in PMAC's list is actually a 
set of animations that are in inventory and get played together for the users
that are seated (typically a couple, 
but PMAC can be set to handle up to 9 concurrent sitters). when you select an
animation, PMAC handles which animation
 is played for each user and where to position them and does so based on
information stored in a notecard.

Usually animations are supplied in "groups" of animations -- perhaps one group
for sitting, one group for lying, 
another group for cuddling, and so on -- each of which has a number of
appropriate animations assigned to it. You 
pick a group, then pick the animation you want to play from that group.

When you first use PMAC it will already have a default group selected and you'll
see the list of animations for that group.  PMAC shows up to 6 animation names,
and if there are more than that you can use the PREV and NEXT buttons to scroll
through additional pages of them (only the 6 animation names at the top change,
the rest of the menu stays the same).

When you pick a new animation the region has to send that to everyone's viewer
and some can take longer to arrive than others, so animations that are intended
to "fit" together can easily get out of synch the first time you use them. Even
if they look fine in your viewer, they might be out of synch for someone else.
Pressing the "SYNCH" button tells all of the viewers to restart the current
animation from the beginning and should fix that for everyone.

The QUIT button does *almost* what you think it does. QUIT makes *everyone*
stand up and stop using the object, not just you. If you want to stop using it
but want to leave everyone else seated, simply "stand" using your viewer. Once
you do so, PMAC will ignore any button you click on the still-open dialog box so
you can either close it or just click any button. The next person who is still
seated and touches the object will take control (automatically).

If you want to change to a different group of animations, press the GROUPS
button to get a list of the groups you can access. Just like the animation menu,
you may need to scroll through pages of them using the PREV and NEXT buttons to
find the one you want. When you pick one, you'll be taken back to the animation
menu with a list of the animations in the group you selected.

If you accidentally close the dialog menu, just touch the object to have it
re-displayed.


**** THE OPTIONS MENU ****

You can enter the options menu by clicking the OPTIONS button on either
animation or groups menu pages and what you see will depend a little on who you
are and what is currently happening (and how the item has been configured). The
buttons on the very top row (EDIT ON and MENUS LOCK/UNLOCK) are only ever
visible to the owner. The others can be available to any user. Here's a quick
look at each:

QUIT does exactly the same thing as it does in all menus -- everyone is forced
to stand.

SYNCH also does exactly the same thing.

BACK  will usually take you back to the animations page unless you're in auto
mode in which case it will take you to the groups menu instead.

SWAP let's you move to another position unless the currently playing animtion is
only set up for a single user. If the animation is set up for two users you'll
immediately swap places (even if there's nobody currently occupying the other
spot). If the animation is for any more than two users you'll be asked what
position you want to move to and who (if anyone) is currently sitting there. You
can't directly make two other people swap places but you could either let one of
them take control for a moment, do the swap, then take control back; or you can
swap with one, then the other, then again with the first person again and you'll
achieve the same thing (it's a little inconvenient, granted, but much simpler on
the "behind the scenes" script level to do it that way).

UNSIT allows you to force someone else to stand. Obviously that might not be a
very polite thing to do but there are a couple cases where it's useful:
- if the other person has gone AFK for a long time and you simply don't want
them standing there
- if one of the other users is an NPC, when you make the NPC stand it will be
removed instead, freeing up the spot for someone else to occupy
- if you want to load an animation group that is for a smaller number of users
than are currently seated you can make someone stand to free up the spot and
allow you to load the new group (be nice about it though...)
If there are only 2 users (yourself and one other) clicking UNSIT will
immediately unsit the other user. If there are more, you'll be asked which user
you want to force to stand.

ADD NPC allows you to have a vacant position filled by an NPC. The button won't
be available if there aren't any empty positions. When you press it you'll be
given a list of the NPCs you can load (it's a multi-page list if there are many
possible options). Select one and wait a moment for the NPC to rez and join you.
To later remove the NPC you can either UNSIT them, or QUIT (which removes all
NPCs) or have all "real" users stand -- if there are no avatars still seated all
remaining NPCs are removed and the script treats it like a QUIT.

[Slight technical note:
After adding an NPC to the last available vacant position the "ADD NPC" button
will often still be shown until you leave the options menu and then return to
it, even though there isn't an available position for the NPC to occupy. If you
try to add another one you'll be informed that there's no room and the button
will update correctly too. This is due to a slight delay in the time it takes an
NPC to sit down and be "registered" as a user which is almost always longer than
the time it takes to redisplay the options menu. While the script could be
changed to "fix" this, it would also mean the menu wouldn't reappear for up to
an additional few seconds (and it is already delayed a little by the need to
wait for the region to register the NPC) which becomes considerably more
annoying than the "phantom" button so I chose to leave this minor "sort-of-bug"
instead.]

AUTO takes you to a menu where you can start or stop PMAC's auto mode. AUTO OFF
stops it. AUTO ON turns it on using whatever the last selected (or default) time
is. Selecting one of the time buttons will turn on auto mode if it isn't
already, and use that selected time.

SPECIALS is a button that is only visible if you are using an PMAC add-on that
needs to offer you a menu button. If you have one that does, you'll find that
button in the list of buttons displayed in the SPECIALS menu. If you have a lot
of add-ons the buttons are sorted alphabetically by name and there could be
multple pages of them. You'll need to consult your add-on's instructions to find
out what their buttons do and sometimes this will temporarily transfer you to a
separate menu system controlled directly by the add-on. Once finished, you
should be automatically returned to the PMAC menu.

For the curious, there is one additional empty button beside SPECIALS that will
always show "-" and be ignored. That's in case there's a need for another button
to do something in a future version of PMAC.


**** OWNER-ONLY OPTIONS ****

The very top row of the options menu is only ever displayed for the owner and
also contains an empty "-" button that doesn't do anything and is for possible
future use. The other two buttons are:

MENUS LOCK/UNLOCK. toggles between allowing other users being allowed to take
control and access the menus. If you LOCK menus then only you can ever take
control and use them. If you UNLOCK them, anyone who is seated can take control.
Be a little cautious with locking menus since PMAC remembers this setting even
after you quit. If the user settings don't cause the script to reset on quit,
you could accidentally leave everyone locked out of being able to use the
controls until you return and unlock if for them. Of course being able to
*intentionally* do this is the whole point of having the button there in the
first place. Just use with care. :)

EDIT ON is probably the most important button on the entire menu for an owner,
but also requires considerably more detailed instructions which aren't suitable
for this basic user instructions notecard. Briefly, though, this switches you
into edit mode, allowing you to then adjust the positions of each animation and
either temporarily or permanently store those changes without ever touching the
notecards or doing any copy-pasting. You cannot enter edit mode unless all
available positions are occupied -- by avatars or NPCs -- and once in edit mode,
you will want to ensure that nobody stands until you've finished and stored your
changes. For all the sordid details, see the Basic Building instructions
notecard.
