Skidz Partz - Exchange: Content Management System
=================================

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU DO THIS,
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR SITE UP AND RUNNING IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

Base Requirements
-----------------

In order to setup Skidz Partz - Exchange the folowing requirements are necessary.

- A Computer with Linux, Windows, Mac OS X or any UNIX flavor installed and working properly.
- Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org)
- PHP version 4.2.x or better (mod_php) Apache module (http://www.php.net)
- MySQL or any other supported SQL database server

NOTE: Skidz Partz - Exchange supports MySQL, SQLite, mSQL, PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL_local, ODBC, ODBC_Adabas, Sybase
and Interbase servers.

The official test and development system is an Apple iMac computer running Mac OS X 10.5.2 with
the package MAMP (MySQL, Apache and PHP).

Setup of these required packages is beyond the scope of this document
and if you are unsure you should check with each of the appropriate web
sites for further details.


Installing the Package
----------------------

Unzip the package into the directory you want to use on you web server, if you're unsure where
that is, ask you system administrator.

Point your browser to your site.

The system will show you an error message with a link to the web based installer utility, follow
the very easy steps and you're done.


First Run
---------

    After installing the system you should have a Super User account.
    Go to the administration system and click on "Preferences" and change whatever you want to fit your
site info. All the options you need to change are in the Preferences menu.


Security Tips
-------------

1) It's a good choice to put your config.php file outside the Web Server path, then
you can create a new config.php with the line:

<?php include("../config.php"); ?>

2) Remember to immediately rename the file "admin.php" to something else and set the new filename
in the config.php file.

3) Even if it can't hurt, delete the "install" folder


Final Notes
-----------    

    That's it! You're done with Skidz Partz - Exchange. Just navigate around, play with it, 
abuse it and if you like Skidz Partz - Exchange, use it. Spend some time getting used to the 
administration interface.

    To change your site's logo, go to the themes directory and make a custom
logo for each individual theme. Just navigate around all themes and change
the graphics you want.

    A note for the Skidz Partz - Exchange site's administrators: Only admins (authors) can
