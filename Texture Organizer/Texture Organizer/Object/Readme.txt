Texture Organizer

by Solo Mornington

Originally created for the Linden Endowment for the Arts sandbox, in Second Life. Visit sometime! http://slurl.com/secondlife/LEA5/122/129/24

This is a single-script texture organizer that does some fancy prim animating because I thought it might be neat.

FEATURES:

* Fancy prim animations. Woot.
* Totally free, open-source, FOSS-happy license.
* Security modes: Owner, group, or everyone can use the organizer.
* Sculpty mode: Have it show you all the textures as sculpties.
* 'Give All' button: Everyone knows how handy that is.
* Low lag, minimal prims...
* Notification of restrictive permissions on textures.

HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT:

1) Make an object with 22 prims.
2) Put the script in the object's root prim.
3) Add textures.
4) You're done.

RESOURCES:

Included in this repository is a set of images used to create the user interface of the texture organizer. The script refers to these textures in Second Life by UUID, so there is no need to upload them, as long as Solo Mornington has an inventory. :-)

LICENSE:
